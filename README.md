# Antigone: Seven Stanzas.

1.  Shaft of the sun, fairest light of all that have dawned on Thebes of the seven gates, you have shone forth at last, eye of golden day, advancing over Dirce's streams! [105] You have goaded with a sharper bit the warrior of the white shield, who came from Argos in full armor, driving him to headlong retreat.


2.  He set out against our land because of the strife-filled claims of Polyneices, and like a screaming eagle he flew over into our land, covered by his snow-white wing, with a mass of weapons and crested helmets.

3.  He paused above our dwellings; he gaped around our sevenfold portals with spears thirsting for blood; but he left before his jaws were ever glutted with our gore, or before the Fire-god's pine-fed flame had seized our crown of towers. So fierce was the crash of battle swelling about his back, a match too hard to win for the rival of the dragon.

4.  For Zeus detests above all the boasts of a proud tongue. And when he saw them advancing in a swollen flood, arrogant their clanging gold, he dashed with brandished fire one who was already starting to shout victory when he had reached our ramparts.

5.  Staggered, he fell to the earth with a crash, torch in hand, a man possessed by the frenzy of the mad attack, who just now was raging against us with the blasts of his tempestuous hate. But his threats did not fare as he had hoped, and to the other enemies mighty Ares dispensed each their own dooms with hard blows, Ares, our mighty ally at the turning-point.

6.  For the seven captains, stationed against an equal number at the seven gates, left behind their brazen arms in tribute to Zeus the turner of battleâ€”all but the accursed pair who, born of one father and one mother, set against each other their spears, both victorious, and who now share in a common death.

7.  But since Victory whose name is glory has come to us, smiling in joy equal to the joy of chariot-rich Thebes, let us make for ourselves forgetfulness after the recent wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance and song. And may Bacchus, who shakes the earth of Thebes, rule our dancing!

## What is this?

A p5.js sketch with some scene-based keyframing and a bit of WebGL, and text from the first chorus of Sophocles' Antigone.  Antigone is a play about the moral necessity of defiance to an unjust state, and is one of if not the earliest work of fiction about tyranny and resistance - it hits hard.  

Three key inspirations for this were: 
- Anne Carson's adaptation, *Antigonick*, which is remarkable
- Sean Graney's adaptation from his 12-hour adaptation of every surviving Greek tragedy, *All Our Tragic* (I saw it twice in Chicago)
- *manifold* by Sophia Wood, who has given me an immense amount of inspiration and pushed me on incorporating text into my work

The text is from Sir Richard Jebb's 1891 translation, taken from the Perseus Digital Library:
